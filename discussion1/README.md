# You may notice that this week's directory is rather empty.
# The only other file here is a hello world program, which we'll use later.

# Since we've just discussed file creation and manipulation, let's fix that!
# First, create a file called "demo.txt". We'll use this as our 'solution' file, where we store the answers to each part.
# Today, our 'answers' will just be the commands used to complete each task.
# Go ahead and write down the command you just used in demo.txt.

# Now, let's use the hello world porgram. If you run it with `./hello`, it'll output "Hello World!" and exit.
# Let's redirect that output into another file, called hello.txt.
# Note that you don't actually have to create the file first, it'll automatically get created when you execute the command.
# Once you've done this, write down the command you used in demo.txt.

# Finally, let's make a new subdirectory and move our hello.txt file into it.
# Name the new directory "" and move the file inside it.
# Write these two commands in demo.txt, and we're almost done.

# Now that we've made some changes to this demo, we can also make a commit to our git repository.
# These commands will be explored in detail in future discussions, but for now, just use:
# `git add .` and `git commit -m "first commit (or any other message in quotes)"` in that order.
# Don't worry about pushing for right now because you may or may not have the correct access set up yet.

# Thanks for coming to discussion!
