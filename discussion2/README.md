This week's directory contains a few C examples.

First, there are the files `pointers.c` and `strings.c`,
which you can use to solve a few simple yet common
issues that appear for beginner C programmers. You can
compile these with the provided makefile, which has a few
targets for compiling and running each individual demo.

Once we're done with that, there's a linked list demo
to complete as practice implementing a data structure.
You can clone either `git@github.com:noah-kuhn/LinkedListDemo.git` 
or `git@github.com:Andrew-William-Smith/c4jp-linked-list.git`
to get started. They are roughly similar to do, it'll
depend on which section you're in for which one you'll do.

Thanks for coming to discussion this week!
